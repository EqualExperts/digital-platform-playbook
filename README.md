# Overview

The Equal Experts Digital Platform playbook is our thinking on why, when, and how to build Digital Platforms. A Digital Platform enables an organisation to achieve Continuous Delivery and Operability at scale. 

Our approach is based on first-hand experience building Digital Platforms, and our deep expertise in both Continuous Delivery and Operability.
