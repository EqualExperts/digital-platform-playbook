# What are the benefits of a Digital Platform

A Digital Platform provides the following benefits:

#### Faster innovation

* Faster time to launch. Automating and abstracting cloud setup and simplifying governance processes means a new Digital Service can be launched to customers within days.
* Frequent updates. Creating an optimal deployment pipeline allows customer experiments in a Digital Service to be updated on at least a daily basis.
* Increased focus on business problems. Institutionalising new policies that cross-cut departments means uncoordinated and/or duplicated processes can be eliminated, and people can focus on higher value work.
* More business model opportunities. Friction-free, rapid launches of Digital Services allow an organisation to separate its differentiating business functions from utilities and to quickly trial different business models in new marketplaces.

#### Higher quality

* Fewer environmental issues. Automating configuration and infrastructure lowers the potential for environment-specific problems.
* More deterministic test results. Centralising automated test executors reduces opportunities for nondeterminism in test suites.
* Faster rollback. Creating an effective rollback system with health checks means deployment failures can be fixed quickly.

#### Increased reliability

* More operable services. Providing logging, monitoring, and alerting out of the box increases the operability of Digital Services, and helps users to quickly discern abnormal operating conditions.
* Graceful degradation. Implementing circuit breakers and bulkheads on the wire for third-party systems allows Digital Services to gracefully degrade on failure.
* Improved business continuity. Automating the entire platform infrastructure in the cloud creates new business continuity options.

#### Improved ways of working

* Policy experimentation. Cutting across departments means new policies can be forged in [inceptions](https://inception.playbook.ee/), [Chaos Day testing](https://chaos-day.playbook.ee/), [secure delivery](https://secure-delivery.playbook.ee/), and more. 
* Drive new practices. Creating [enabling constraints](https://theitriskmanager.com/2018/12/09/constraints-that-enable/) in user journeys can drive the adoption of new practices, such as restricting shared libraries to encourage decoupled domains for Digital Services.
* Simpler processes. Establishing meaningful Service Level Objectives with an automated alerting toolchain can make You Build It You Run It production support easier to set up.

#### Advanced technology

* Use the best available technologies. Standardising cloud building blocks means the best available technology stack can be provided to Digital Service teams.
* Traffic optimisations. Surfacing self-service, elastic infrastructure means Digital Service teams can easily optimise for fluctuating traffic patterns without significant costs.
* Zero downtime updates. Consolidating service runtimes means functional updates can be continually applied with zero downtime for Digital Services.

#### Reduced costs

* Economies of scale. Centralising the Digital Service lifecycle means economies of scale can be achieved, as more Digital Service teams can be added without incurring repeat buy/build costs.
* Easier cost management. Centralising self-service touchpoints for automated infrastructure allows infrastructure costs to be visualised and closely managed. 
* Positioning security specialists in the Digital Platform teams means security threats can be more easily identified and Digital Services can quickly receive security updates. 

#### Happier, more productive people

* Lower cognitive load. Abstracting away the Digital Service lifecycle reduces your staffâ€™s cognitive load, reducing lead times to less than 24 hours for a new joiner, a mover between teams, a leaver, or a new Digital Service team.
* Easier to identify talent needs. Splitting business domains into Digital Services helps to highlight which domains are true business differentiators and require the most talented engineers.
* Increased talent attractors. Using the latest cloud technology on Digital Platform and Digital Service teams will encourage talented engineers to join your organisation.
* More recruitment options. Concentrating specialist skills in Digital Platform teams means recruitment efforts for Digital Service teams can focus on onshore/offshore developers, testers, etc. without requiring more costly, specialised cloud skills.
