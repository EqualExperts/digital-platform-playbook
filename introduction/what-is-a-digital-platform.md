# What is a Digital Platform

At Equal Experts, we define a **Digital Platform** as follows:

> A Digital Platform is a bespoke Platform as a Service \(PaaS\) product composed of people, processes, and tools, that enables teams to rapidly develop, iterate, and operate Digital Services at scale.

A Digital Platform will allow your organisation to accelerate its time to market, increase revenue, reduce costs, and create innovative products for your customers.

A Digital Platform is:

* _Differentiating_. It empowers your teams to concentrate on solving real business problems by abstracting away organisational complexities and toil.
* _A product._ It’s built incrementally by incorporating feedback from your teams. It accelerates the delivery of Digital Services. It's enduring.
* _Opinionated_. It makes it easy for your teams to build, deploy, and operate Digital Services by providing a curated set of high quality building blocks.

A Digital Platform is also:

* _Not a commodity_. It cannot be bought off the shelf, as it must satisfy the specific needs of your organisation. It’s built by weaving together open-source and bespoke commodity tools to create a technology accelerator.
* _Not a project._ It isn’t a one-off development with a fixed end date. It needs to keep changing, as the needs of your teams will change based on their customers’ demands.
* _Not a universal infrastructure platform_. It cannot run all cloud services for all possible consumers without weakening the proposition. It needs to focus on a subset of cloud services to support Digital Service workloads.

It’s important to remember that a Digital Platform isn’t a silver bullet. It’s a long-term commitment to Digital Services at scale. It’s not appropriate for all workloads, teams, or organisations. For more on this, see [when to start a Digital Platform](https://digital-platform.playbook.ee/introduction/when-to-start-a-digital-platform).

A **Digital Service** is a software service designed to fulfil a product capability and run on a Digital Platform. Such a service might be a monolith, or composed of multiple microservices. It’s usually based on modern software development principles, such as [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) or [Secure Delivery](https://secure-delivery.playbook.ee/). It's owned by a single Digital Service team responsible for understanding its customers, and producing a service that meets their needs.

Here’s a services diagram of a fictional Digital Platform in a retail organisation. It shows eight Digital Services in development within two different retail domains, as well as six platform capabilities within the Digital Platform itself.
