# Introduction

This playbook defines the principles and practices Equal Experts recommend for designing Digital Platforms. 

_A Digital Platform is a bespoke Platform as a Service \(PaaS\) product composed of people, processes, and tools that enables teams to rapidly develop, iterate, and operate Digital Services at scale._ 

To be competitive, your organisation must rapidly explore new product offerings as well as exploit established products. New ideas must be validated and refined with customers as quickly as possible, if product/market fit and repeatable success are to be found.

You might have multiple teams in a brownfield or greenfield IT estate, where your ability to deliver product features is constrained by your technology capabilities. In either scenario, a Digital Platform optimised for the delivery of Digital Services might be an accelerator for your organisation – if you can make a multi-year commitment to investment. A Digital Platform isn’t a small undertaking, and requires ongoing funding for you to realise the greatest benefits..

For example, here’s a team diagram for a fictional Digital Platform. It shows one team working on the Digital Platform, and five teams using it to build Digital Services. Teams within the organisation are able to offer additional expertise, and third-party support is also available from suppliers such as your public cloud provider.
